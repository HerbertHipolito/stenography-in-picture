# stenography-in-picture
Algorithm to hide a message in a picture by applying 2 least significant bits using Python. This code transforms the message to be hidden in binary and replaces only the 2
least significant bits from each RGB number of the picture per 2 bits from the converted message. The change in the colour pixels is not significant to be notable.
